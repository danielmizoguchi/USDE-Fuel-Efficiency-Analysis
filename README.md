# USDE-Fuel-Efficiency-Analysis

The key objectives of this study are as follows:
• Understand the relationship between fuel economy and primarily engine displacement, as well as that between fuel economy and any other useful explanatory variables.
• Develop a causal model for fuel economy, that includes engine displacement. 
• Develop an optimal model for predicting fuel economy.

The objectives of this analysis were achieved in this group project using knowledge of two sample testing, simple linear and multiple linear regressions and non-linear transformations. The fit and accuracy of predictions were assessed throughout using adjusted and forecasted measures of r-squared.
